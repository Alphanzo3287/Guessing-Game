# Instructions  
Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 500 and asks the user to guess what the number is. If the user’s guess is higher than the random number, the program should display “Too high, try again.” If the user’s guess is lower than the random number, the program should display “Too low, try again.” You can use 1 of the 2 ways we have learned to create your random numbers. Remember we covered random number generation in a previous week?

The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number.

Count the number of guesses that the user makes. When the user correctly guesses the random number, the program should display a user-friendly message and the number of guesses.

(HINT: Design your code with an If/Else structure nested inside of a loop. You decide which loop structure is best to use.)

Here's a short demo of how the game should function.
